Pebble-Thermostat
=================

Control RTCoA Wifi Thermostat from Pebble

Needs an intermediary script that does some stuff, url goes in pebble-js-app.js more docs on that later.

Just displays mode, inside temp, setpoint will add changing setpoint.

May add setting URL for control script via Pebble iOS/Android app configuration in the future if local config html is added.
